# CSCE361 Group 4 Project: Ecommerce Website

#### Group Members
James Nguyen, Tai Vo, Albert Li, Krishna Kotha, Justin Le

## What is Included in the Repository
#### Ecommerce Model
Folder that contains our Ecommerce Website Solution and all the required parts of the MVC architectural structure.
#### MVC Unit Test
Folder that contains the unit tests we created for the User, Admin, and Home Page.
#### Class Diagram
The UML diagram that was created based on the C# classes in the solution folder, including the Controllers and Models.
#### Online Store DB ER Diagram
The ER diagram outlining the entity relationships between the tables in our MySQL database.
#### MySQL.sql
The SQL database tables that were created using MySQL and integrated into our program using a SQL Server.

## Extra Instructions
The website should be launched from the Index.cshtml file found in Views/Home since that is our main home page. As we were unable to launch our database and our project using Azure, our tables are dropped everytime the project is run. When the database is opened and connected in Visual Studio before the preview is launched, the project is unable to be ran. If you are to open the database connection before running the program, Visual Studio may have to be closed and re-opened if it does not initially work.
